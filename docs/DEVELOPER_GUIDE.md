This document describes the completed **console release** of MyOS. It is intended for developers, systems programmers and readers who need a map of the source tree and the technical invariants. The fixed release point is the annotated tag `v0.12.0-console` on commit `1a454cb`.

> `main` and `console-stable` point to the console milestone. GUI experiments must live only in separate branches and must not change this release without a separate decision.

## 1. Build and test contract

### Host dependencies

| Tool | Usage |
|---|---|
| `gcc`, `ld`, `nasm`, `make` | Build freestanding C11 kernel, user ELF and ASM. |
| `xorriso`, `mtools` | Create ISO and FAT EFI partition. |
| `sgdisk` | Create GPT raw image. |
| `qemu-system-x86_64` | BIOS and UEFI regression. |
| OVMF | UEFI firmware for QEMU. |

### Make targets

| Target | Output / purpose |
|---|---|
| `make` or `make all` | Builds the hybrid BIOS/UEFI ISO `myos.iso`. |
| `make img` | Recreates the 128 MiB raw GPT image `myos.img`. |
| `make run` | BIOS ISO test in headless serial mode. |
| `make run-graphic` | BIOS ISO test with framebuffer window. |
| `make run-uefi` | UEFI ISO test in headless serial mode. |
| `make run-uefi-graphic` | UEFI ISO test with framebuffer window. |
| `make debug` | Starts QEMU paused with GDB server on TCP 1234. |
| `make inspect` | Prints ELF headers and sections. |

The raw image is the authoritative storage test target because AHCI read/write and persistent files require a Q35 IDE-attached raw disk:

```bash
make all img
qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -machine q35 -m 256M \
  -drive if=ide,format=raw,file=myos.img \
  -boot c -serial stdio -display none
```

For UEFI, provide mutable OVMF variables and boot the same raw image:

```bash
cp /usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_VARS_4M.fd /tmp/myos-vars.fd
qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -machine q35 -m 256M \
  -drive if=pflash,format=raw,readonly=on,file=/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE_4M.fd \
  -drive if=pflash,format=raw,file=/tmp/myos-vars.fd \
  -drive if=ide,format=raw,file=myos.img \
  -boot c -serial stdio -display none
```

## 2. Repository map

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `boot/` | Higher-half linker script and Limine boot menu/configuration. |
| `include/` | Kernel/user ABI contracts: scheduling, paging, syscalls, VFS, pipes, AHCI and architecture helpers. |
| `kernel/main.c` | Limine requests, bootstrap ordering, diagnostics and handoff to kernel shell. |
| `kernel/arch/x86_64/` | GDT, IDT, TSS, APIC, syscall entry and low-level NASM primitives. |
| `kernel/console/` | COM1 mirror, framebuffer text console and kernel shell. |
| `kernel/mm/` | PMM, four-level page tables, user address spaces and kernel heap. |
| `kernel/sched/` | Round-robin scheduler, task lifecycle, context switch and input waits. |
| `kernel/sys/` | SYSCALL/SYSRET dispatcher, user-copy validation and ABI enforcement. |
| `kernel/loader/` | newc CPIO reader, ELF64 loading and bounded process spawn. |
| `kernel/fs/` | Read-only initramfs VFS, tmpfs and persistent-file backend. |
| `kernel/ipc/` | Bounded one-way pipe table and endpoint lifetime. |
| `kernel/drivers/` | PIT, PS/2 keyboard, RTC, PIC, PCI and AHCI. |
| `user/` | Ring-3 shell, freestanding user programs and initramfs payload. |
| `tools/mkcpio.py` | Deterministic user-program/initramfs packaging helper. |

## 3. Bootstrap and execution model

The boot path is deliberately simple and linear.

```text
Limine
  -> kernel_entry (NASM)
  -> kmain
  -> serial + framebuffer console
  -> GDT / IDT / TSS / syscall MSRs
  -> PMM + paging + heap
  -> ACPI / PIC / PIT / PS2 / RTC / PCI / AHCI
  -> initramfs + VFS + persistent mount
  -> scheduler and kernel workers
  -> three-second auto-init countdown
  -> `K` cancellation to kernel shell, or `/init` user process
  -> ring-3 user shell
```

Limine supplies the framebuffer, memory map, firmware information, RSDP and initramfs module. MyOS keeps a higher-half kernel around `0xffffffff80000000`, uses the HHDM supplied by Limine during bootstrap and owns a four-level PML4 for its mappings. User programs run in separate address spaces and enter the kernel through `SYSCALL/SYSRET`.

### Privilege and task model

| Item | Current value / policy |
|---|---|
| Target architecture | x86_64 only; no 32-bit compatibility target. |
| Task slots | 16 total scheduler slots. |
| Kernel stack | 64 KiB per task. |
| Scheduling | PIT IRQ0 at 100 Hz; round-robin READY task selection. |
| User mapping range | `0x0000000000001000`–`0x00007FFFFFFFFFFF`. |
| Kernel heap | 1 GiB virtual reservation at `0xFFFF900000000000`. |
| Process states | UNUSED, READY, RUNNING, SLEEPING, ZOMBIE, WAITING and INPUT. |

The scheduler updates TSS RSP0 and activates the task address space on each context switch. `wait`, `sleep`, console input and pipe reads block through scheduler state rather than busy-waiting.

## 4. Syscall boundary

`include/syscall.h` is the shared user/kernel ABI. The dispatcher in `kernel/sys/syscall.c` validates descriptor values, limits and user address ranges before copying. User buffers are copied through page-aware `copy_from_user` and `copy_to_user`; direct user pointers are not trusted.

The release includes write/read, process lifecycle, task info, VFS read/enumeration, RTC/uptime, bounded spawn arguments, tmpfs/persistent-file operations, pipe operations, reboot and poweroff. The most important limits are:

| Limit | Value |
|---|---:|
| Generic write syscall payload | 256 bytes |
| Spawn path | 16 bytes including terminator capacity |
| Spawn argument storage | 128 bytes |
| VFS read chunk | 128 bytes |
| tmpfs/persistent write chunk | 128 bytes |
| Pipe channels | 4 |
| Pipe capacity per channel | 256 bytes |

The source of truth is always the structures and constants in `include/syscall.h`, not this table, when changing the ABI.

## 5. Filesystem and storage design

### VFS layers

The VFS lookup order and implementation are in `kernel/fs/vfs.c`.

| Namespace | Backend | Lifetime |
|---|---|---|
| Initramfs entries such as `motd.txt` and programs | Read-only newc CPIO | Built into image. |
| `tmp/<name>` | In-memory bounded tmpfs | Lost at reboot. |
| `disk/<name>` | Bounded persistent backend over guarded AHCI data LBAs | Survives reboot of the same `myos.img`. |

Both writable stores are intentionally bounded. The persistent backend uses one metadata sector and one guarded data sector per file. It supports at most 8 files, each up to 512 bytes. This is a demonstration filesystem, not a POSIX filesystem.

### Raw image invariant

`myos.img` is a 128 MiB GPT disk image with three partitions.

| Partition | LBA range | Type / purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| 1 | 34–2047 | BIOS boot partition for Limine. |
| 2 | 2048–67583 | EFI FAT partition containing boot files. |
| 3 | 67584–262110 | Isolated MyOS data partition. |

`ahci_write_data_sector()` accepts only data-partition LBAs. The final data sector is reserved for write/readback diagnostics; the persistent VFS uses the remaining reserved layout. Any change to the image layout, AHCI guard constants or persistent metadata must update all three together and repeat BIOS/UEFI tests.

## 6. Input, console and user shell

COM1 output is mirrored to the framebuffer text console. The keyboard driver handles PS/2 Set 1 US QWERTY characters and wakes tasks in `INPUT` state. After bootstrap, `kernel/console/shell.c` waits three seconds for `K` from PS/2 or COM1: no cancellation starts `/init` automatically; `K` retains the diagnostic kernel shell, where `init` still launches the same user shell manually. If `/init` is unavailable or automatic loading fails, the kernel reports the condition and remains in kernel shell without retry looping.

The user shell provides deterministic history navigation and unique-prefix Tab completion. Its command list and command semantics are the source of truth for end-user documentation. Changes to `command_help()`, `execute_command()` or a user program should be reflected in `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` and `README.md`.

## 7. Validation baseline

Before committing a console change, at minimum perform:

| Test | Expected result |
|---|---|
| `make all img` | Strict `-Werror` build and both artifacts complete. |
| BIOS raw image | Limine boot, automatic `/init` after three seconds, then user shell. |
| BIOS cancellation | `K` during countdown keeps kernel shell; manual `init` reaches user shell. |
| UEFI raw image | Equivalent automatic startup and user shell through OVMF. |
| Fallback check | Missing or failed `/init` leaves diagnostic kernel shell without retry loop. |
| Process check | `run hello`, `spawn sleeper 1`, `ps`, `wait` or `kill`. |
| Filesystem check | Create/write/read/remove a `tmp/` file and a `disk/` file. |
| Persistence check | Reboot the same `myos.img`, then read a previous `disk/` file. |
| IPC check | `pipe sample`; run `wc` or `grep` against a file. |

For storage code, test both firmware paths on **the same image**: write in BIOS, then read in UEFI. Never test raw AHCI writes on a host block device unless an isolated disposable test device is explicitly intended.

## 8. Git workflow

| Reference | Rule |
|---|---|
| `v0.12.0-console` | Do not move or rewrite. It freezes the completed console OS. |
| `main` | Console release branch. Restrict changes to release fixes, documentation and explicitly approved console maintenance. |
| `console-stable` | Optional maintenance line at the same baseline. Cherry-pick tested fixes deliberately. |
| `gui/bringup` | Separate GUI experimentation. Do not merge it into `main` unless a future GUI release is explicitly approved. |

A normal GitHub publication should push `main`, `console-stable` and the annotated console tag. Build artifacts `myos.iso` and `myos.img` are release attachments, not Git-tracked source files.

## 9. Known technical limits

This is a console milestone, not a production OS. Current non-goals include networking, USB HID, SMP, IOAPIC routing, NVMe, demand paging, dynamic linker, Unix ABI compatibility, package management, full filesystem semantics, Secure Boot and production security hardening. AHCI is deliberately limited to one bounded sector operation and the known isolated data range.

The next project phase, if resumed, is GUI work in a separate branch. Do not add GUI interfaces or GUI user commands to this console guide or console release branch.

## 10. Documentation maintenance

Documentation changes are part of feature maintenance. Any change to build/run behavior, public shell behavior, ABI, storage layout, host support, branch policy or safety guidance must update the corresponding documentation in the same commit. The authoritative checklist is [DOCUMENTATION_POLICY.md](DOCUMENTATION_POLICY.md).
